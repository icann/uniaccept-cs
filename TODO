FUTURE WORK:

* A more automated update mechanism that does not rely on the system
administrator calling refreshtlddb() on a schedule. (i.e. at every
execution, check last modified date, and only schedule update if older
than 'x')

* Use proper packaging for the various modules (e.g. a proper Perl
bundle)
